                <p>Memory Pirate began as a course project exploring the use of constraints to present views beautifully
                    on any Apple device and any device orientation. Design and prototyping were completed using Adobe
                    XD. The original version was developed in Xcode with Swift and UIKit. I later decided to update the
                    project to the newer SwiftUI framework with the expectation that handling device size and
                    orientations would not be ass difficult as they were with the previous UIKit iteration. This turned
                    out to be a false assumption. Although the SwiftUI Views handle size changes more gracefully,
                    handling orientation changes remain challenging. This current SwiftUI version of Memory Pirates uses
                    CloudKit, and GameCenter for data persistence and friendly competition. Available NOW on the Apple
                    App Store!</p>
