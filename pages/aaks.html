            <p> war will be the end of all if we as individuals continue to fall for the clever marketing promoting
                'war for peace.' to survive this century, we must work to shift our collective consciousness. will
                we come together as neighbors sharing one planet? or do we continue to kill millions as ordered by
                the elite few? </p>
            <p> the Artists Against Killing Strangers gallery is a collection of works from various artists in
                support of ending the senseless killing of strangers in the name of peace, freedom, and false
                promises. the goal is to help others recognize the misdirection of world leaders. when your brother
                doesn't share their pool with you, or perhaps they do share your wife, much of the world knows that
                killing is not an acceptable solution. it may require the fear of consequence, but you still know.
                when world leaders disagree, they tell us to ignore reason and kill the enemy, the stranger whose
                only fault was believing a different lie.</p>
            <p> we may never witness the end of all wars in our lifetime. so please encourage our children to
                consider the hypocrisy of law and war. both are orders from those to whom we give control. the
                former forbids killing for any reason. the latter rewards killing without reason. </p>
